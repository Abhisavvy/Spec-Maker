HOW TO ADD PROFESSIONAL ASSETS
==============================

I've set up everything for you! Here's the fastest way to add assets:

1. VISIT: https://polyhaven.com/textures

2. DOWNLOAD these textures (all free, CC0 license):
   - Concrete Floor: https://polyhaven.com/a/concrete_floor_001
   - Metal Rusty: https://polyhaven.com/a/metal_rusty_001  
   - Concrete Wall: https://polyhaven.com/a/concrete_wall_001

3. FOR EACH TEXTURE:
   - Click "Download" → Choose "JPG" format
   - Extract the ZIP file
   - Rename files:
     * diffuse_1k.jpg → albedo.jpg
     * normal_1k.jpg → normal.jpg
     * roughness_1k.jpg → roughness.jpg
     * metalness_1k.jpg → metallic.jpg
     * ao_1k.jpg → ao.jpg

4. PLACE FILES:
   - Concrete Floor → textures/ground/
   - Metal Rusty → textures/obstacle/
   - Concrete Wall → textures/platform/

5. UPDATE: src/config/assets.ts (uncomment the paths)

6. RESTART: npm run dev

That's it! The game will automatically use your professional assets.
