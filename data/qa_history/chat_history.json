    "question": "How many spins can I do in a day",
    "answer": "### \ud83d\udccb **CONTEXT**\nThe user is asking about the maximum number of spins a player can perform for the **Spinner (Lucky Spin)** feature within a day. This feature allows players to watch rewarded ads for various rewards.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf **DIRECT ANSWER**\nPlayers can do a maximum of **4 spins** within each 12-hour window. Since the spin cap resets twice a day (at 6 AM and 6 PM local time), a player can effectively perform up to **8 spins** in a 24-hour period if they utilize both reset windows.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **EVIDENCE**\n\"[Source: Spinner.pptx, UI & Mechanic, Spinner pop-up]\" states:\n*   \"Player will be able to spin upto 4 times within set 12 hours (local time)\"\n*   \"At 6am and 6pm, the spin cap will reset\"\n*   The `no_spins` runtime default value for both payers and non-payers is `4`."
